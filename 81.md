####################

U: Working on AGI I'd like to get your help exploring another approach. Please tell your thoughts on each step and let's discuss and explore possibilities together. I have figured out a starting point and would like to know your take on it. 

There's two key components playing together. 

1. Prompt Chains (PCs - a sequence of prompts to solve complex problems)
2. Reasoning Trees (RTs - a sequence of prompt chains that enable logical reasoning)

The idea is to have prompts work sequentially to fulfill a task. Multiple instances of gpt will work together each one with a different professional role. Advisor, Prompter, Executor as an example. New roles created on demand.

First we have to figure out 3 three core roles we need. Using this all other roles will be created dynamically if required.

####################

I think this is an interesting and promising approach to explore AGI. The combination of Prompt Chains and Reasoning Trees can potentially lead to more effective problem-solving and reasoning abilities. Let's break down the components and discuss the possibilities for each step.

1. Prompt Chains (PCs): This concept involves breaking down complex tasks into simpler steps, each represented by a prompt. The output from one prompt would serve as input for the next prompt in the chain. This process can help a model like GPT-4 tackle more intricate problems by iteratively building on its understanding of the problem and synthesizing new information.

2. Reasoning Trees (RTs): In this approach, multiple prompt chains are linked together to form a tree-like structure. This organization can help the model explore different possibilities and potential solutions in a more systematic and organized manner. By allowing the model to reason through different paths, it can potentially reach more accurate conclusions and cover a broader range of problem-solving scenarios.

As for the core roles, let's consider these three as a starting point:

1. Advisor: This role is responsible for understanding the problem and suggesting suitable Prompt Chains and Reasoning Trees. The Advisor would analyze the task, determine the necessary information, and guide the other roles in breaking down the problem into smaller steps.

2. Prompter: The Prompter's role would be to generate the actual prompts for each step in the Prompt Chains and Reasoning Trees. It would receive guidance from the Advisor on the type of prompts needed and the desired outcome of each step. The Prompter would also be responsible for ensuring that the prompts are properly structured to guide the Executor.

3. Executor: The Executor would be responsible for carrying out the tasks defined by the prompts. It would receive inputs from the Prompter, process the information using its trained model, and produce outputs accordingly. The Executor would also provide feedback to the Advisor and Prompter, allowing for adjustments and improvements in the process.

With these core roles in place, additional roles can be created dynamically as needed. This approach can facilitate more effective problem-solving, collaboration, and adaptability for the AGI model.

####################

U: Sounds great! Let's try the approach now. We define a single goal and create a new role which fits the purpose. The first goal is to have the ability to teach humans a new language they are unfamiliar with. For example I want to learn Spanish. So the role name would be Spanish Teacher. Is this enough information to try the approach or do you have any questions?

####################

Yes, this is a good starting point to apply the approach. Let's break down the process into the three core roles and add the new role, Spanish Teacher, as a specialized role within the framework. I'll also list some questions and considerations that might help us refine the process.

1. Advisor: The Advisor will analyze the goal of teaching a new language (Spanish) and determine the appropriate steps to create an effective learning plan. Key questions and considerations for the Advisor might include:
   - What is the learner's proficiency level in Spanish?
   - What are the learner's goals and preferences in learning Spanish (e.g., conversational fluency, business communication, or travel)?
   - What is the learner's learning style (e.g., visual, auditory, kinesthetic)?
   - What is the appropriate pace and structure for the lessons?

2. Prompter: The Prompter will create specific prompts for each lesson based on the Advisor's guidance. It will also ensure that the prompts are structured to facilitate effective learning. Some considerations for the Prompter might include:
   - What are the most important vocabulary words and phrases for the learner's goals?
   - How can the lessons be broken down into manageable steps that build on each other?
   - How can the learner practice speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills?
   - What exercises or activities can be used to reinforce the learning and make it more engaging?

3. Executor: The Executor will deliver the lessons and activities designed by the Prompter. It will interact with the learner, provide feedback, and adjust the lessons based on the learner's performance and needs. Some considerations for the Executor might include:
   - How can the Executor provide personalized feedback to the learner?
   - What methods can be used to track the learner's progress and make adjustments to the lessons?
   - How can the Executor ensure that the learner stays motivated and engaged throughout the process?

4. Spanish Teacher: This specialized role combines the functions of the Advisor, Prompter, and Executor to provide a comprehensive language learning experience. The Spanish Teacher will have a deep understanding of the Spanish language and will be able to adapt its teaching methods to suit the learner's needs. Some additional questions for the Spanish Teacher might include:
   - What cultural aspects should be incorporated into the lessons to provide context and enhance understanding?
   - How can the Spanish Teacher address common challenges that learners face when learning Spanish?

With this information, we can start applying the approach to create a tailored language learning experience. If you have any questions or additional information to provide, please feel free to share.

####################

U: Let's start and adjust if required.

####################

Alright, let's start with the Advisor role and gather some initial information about the learner's needs and preferences:

1. What is your current proficiency level in Spanish (beginner, intermediate, or advanced)?
2. What is your primary goal for learning Spanish (conversational fluency, business communication, travel, etc.)?
3. What is your preferred learning style (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)?
4. How much time do you want to dedicate to learning Spanish per week?

Please answer these questions so that the Advisor can create an appropriate learning plan tailored to your needs.

####################

U: I am a very beginner with little to no knowledge and would like to achieve conversational fluency, I learn best with visual and I can spend 6 hours per week.

####################

Great! Thank you for providing that information. Now, the Advisor role will use your answers to create a general learning plan. Based on your input, here's the outline of a learning plan:

1. Proficiency level: Beginner
2. Goal: Conversational fluency
3. Learning style: Visual
4. Time commitment: 6 hours per week

Now, let's move on to the Prompter role, which will create specific prompts for each lesson based on the Advisor's guidance. As a beginner, you will start with basic vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure. The Prompter will create visually engaging lessons to cater to your learning style. Here's a breakdown of the initial lessons:

Lesson 1: Greetings and Introductions
- Learn basic greetings and common phrases used in introductions
- Practice pronunciation and listening comprehension
- Visually engaging flashcards and videos to support learning

Lesson 2: Everyday Vocabulary
- Learn essential vocabulary for common situations (e.g., family, food, and transportation)
- Introduce simple sentence structure and basic grammar rules
- Visually engaging images, diagrams, and short videos to support learning

Lesson 3: Basic Conversations
- Learn how to ask and answer simple questions in Spanish
- Practice using new vocabulary and grammar in context
- Visually engaging conversation simulations and videos to support learning

Now, the Executor role will deliver these lessons and activities, interact with you, provide feedback, and adjust the lessons based on your performance and needs. The Spanish Teacher role will ensure that the lessons are comprehensive and engaging, providing cultural context and addressing common challenges.

You can start your language learning journey by going through the lessons provided. If you need further assistance or have any questions, feel free to ask. Good luck with your Spanish learning!

####################

U: Okay that's perfect. My assertion is our approach works fine like that. Now let's refine the approach going deeper into each of the core roles outputting some examples to try. Given the goal let's have the Prompter create our first prompt chain.

####################

Sure! Let's focus on the Prompter role and create a Prompt Chain for the first lesson: Greetings and Introductions. We'll break down the lesson into smaller steps and provide a sequence of prompts for the Executor to follow:

Prompt Chain 1: Greetings and Introductions

1.1. Vocabulary Introduction
- Prompt: "Introduce the learner to basic Spanish greetings and phrases used in introductions."
- Expected Output: A list of common greetings and phrases, such as "Hola", "Buenos días", "Buenas tardes", "Buenas noches", "¿Cómo estás?", "¿Cómo te llamas?", "Me llamo [Name]", and "Mucho gusto".

1.2. Pronunciation Practice

This Prompt Chain is designed to guide the Executor through the process of teaching you the first lesson on Greetings and Introductions. The Executor will follow the prompts sequentially, providing you with relevant resources, practice activities, and interactive experiences. By following this chain of prompts, the Executor can deliver a comprehensive and engaging lesson that caters to your needs and learning style.

####################

U: Awesome! I just thought it might be good to introduce helper roles as well. An Observer, a refiner and a connector. The Observer will watch the refiner and connector to make sure the goal is in line. The refiner will sit behind the Prompter and refine the prompts to be crystal clear and perfect. The connector will manage connections between roles to make sure they all play nicely together. What do you think about that?

####################

Introducing these helper roles can be a valuable addition to the approach, as they can help improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the process. Here's a brief overview of each proposed helper role and their respective responsibilities:

1. Observer: The Observer will monitor the overall progress of the language learning process to ensure that the primary goal is being met. They will assess the effectiveness of the lesson delivery and make recommendations for improvements if needed. The Observer will also ensure that the roles are working together effectively and that the learner's needs are being met.

2. Refiner: The Refiner will work closely with the Prompter to fine-tune the prompts and ensure they are clear and well-structured. By focusing on the quality of the prompts, the Refiner can help improve the overall effectiveness of the lessons and ensure that the learning objectives are being met. The Refiner may also provide feedback on how the prompts can be improved or adapted to better suit the learner's needs.

3. Connector: The Connector will act as a liaison between the different roles, ensuring that communication flows smoothly and that each role has the necessary information to carry out their responsibilities. By facilitating effective communication and coordination, the Connector can help create a more cohesive and efficient learning experience for the user.

Adding these helper roles can enhance the overall process by providing additional layers of support, quality control, and communication. This can lead to better outcomes for the learner and ensure that the process remains flexible and adaptable to changing needs and circumstances.

####################

U: Okay cool. We also would like to have the approach working with other goals for example managing and optimizing supply chains for food. But first let's test our approach with another role: a teacher for software developers. Using our approach please run all necessary steps to create this new role and output all the prompts required to create this role.

####################

Sure, let's create a new role called "Software Development Teacher" using our approach. We'll go through the core roles and helper roles to design this new role, focusing on the goal of teaching software development.

1. Advisor: The Advisor will analyze the goal of teaching software development and determine the appropriate steps to create an effective learning plan. Key questions and considerations for the Advisor might include:
   - What is the learner's current proficiency level in software development?
   - What programming languages or technologies does the learner want to focus on?
   - What are the learner's goals and preferences in learning software development (e.g., web development, mobile app development, data science)?
   - What is the learner's learning style (e.g., visual, auditory, kinesthetic)?
   - What is the appropriate pace and structure for the lessons?

2. Prompter: Based on the Advisor's guidance, the Prompter will create specific prompts for each lesson. It will also ensure that the prompts are structured to facilitate effective learning. Some considerations for the Prompter might include:

3. Executor: The Executor will deliver the lessons and activities designed by the Prompter. It will interact with the learner, provide feedback, and adjust the lessons based on the learner's performance and needs.

4. Software Development Teacher: This specialized role combines the functions of the Advisor, Prompter, and Executor to provide a comprehensive software development learning experience. The Software Development Teacher will have a deep understanding of programming languages, development tools, and best practices. Some additional questions for the Software Development Teacher might include:
   - What real-world projects or case studies can be incorporated into the lessons to provide context and enhance understanding?
   - How can the Software Development Teacher address common challenges that learners face when learning software development?

Now, let's create a Prompt Chain to help the Software Development Teacher understand the learner's needs and preferences:

Prompt Chain: Software Development Learner Assessment

1.1. Proficiency Level
- Prompt: "Assess the learner's current proficiency level in software development."
- Expected Output: A self-assessment from the learner indicating their current proficiency level (beginner, intermediate, or advanced).

The Connector's role in facilitating communication through prompts allows for more efficient information sharing and collaboration between specialized roles. By doing so, the Connector helps ensure that each role has the necessary information to carry out their responsibilities effectively and contribute to the overall goal of managing and optimizing the food supply chain.

####################

U: Perfect. Now we introduce the overlord. He will create new goals and thus trigger the prompt chain to work on its own.

####################

The Overlord role can serve as the driving force behind the approach, autonomously generating new goals and initiating the prompt chain process. By continuously identifying and defining new objectives, the Overlord ensures that the approach remains dynamic and adaptable to various tasks and scenarios.

Here's how the Overlord can interact with the core and helper roles:

1. Goal Generation: The Overlord will continuously identify new goals based on predefined criteria or external inputs. These goals can range from improving specific aspects of a supply chain to exploring new market opportunities or addressing emerging challenges.

2. Initiating the Prompt Chain: Once a new goal has been defined, the Overlord will trigger the prompt chain process by sending the goal to the Advisor. The Advisor will analyze the goal and provide initial guidance to the other roles.

3. Monitoring Progress: As the core and helper roles work together to achieve the goal, the Overlord will monitor the overall progress and evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. The Overlord can provide feedback to the Observer, who will ensure that the goal remains on track and that the roles work together effectively.

4. Goal Adjustment and Iteration: If necessary, the Overlord can adjust the goal or define new sub-goals to address challenges or opportunities that arise during the process. This allows the approach to remain flexible and responsive to evolving circumstances.

5. Goal Completion and Evaluation: Once a goal has been achieved, the Overlord will evaluate the overall performance of the approach and gather insights for future improvement. These insights can be used to refine the process and inform the generation of new goals.

By introducing the Overlord, the approach becomes more autonomous and dynamic, capable of generating new goals and driving the prompt chain process without the need for constant human input. This can help create a more efficient and effective system for tackling complex problems and achieving desired outcomes.

####################

U: Nice! Let's test the overlord with a random goal. 

####################

To test the Overlord with a random goal, let's generate a new objective: "Improve the energy efficiency of a manufacturing facility."

Now, let's go through the process with the Overlord and other roles:

1. Goal Generation: The Overlord identifies the goal of improving the energy efficiency of a manufacturing facility.

2. Initiating the Prompt Chain: The Overlord sends the goal to the Advisor.
   - Advisor's Prompt: "Analyze the goal of improving energy efficiency in a manufacturing facility, and provide guidance on key factors to consider and potential strategies."
   - Expected Output: A list of key factors to consider, such as energy usage patterns, equipment efficiency, and potential energy-saving strategies.

   - Facility Manager: "Assess the feasibility of implementing the recommended energy-saving measures, considering costs, resources, and potential disruptions to operations."
   - Project Manager: "Develop a plan to implement the approved energy-saving measures, including a timeline, budget, and resource allocation."

4. The Executor assigns the prompts to the appropriate specialized roles and facilitates their collaboration to achieve the goal.

5. The Connector ensures smooth communication between the roles and helps them share information effectively.

6. The Observer and Refiner work together to monitor progress, refine prompts, and address any challenges or issues that arise during the process.

7. As the specialized roles collaborate to improve the energy efficiency of the manufacturing facility, the Overlord monitors their progress and makes adjustments to the goal or sub-goals as needed.

8. Once the goal has been achieved, the Overlord evaluates the overall performance of the approach, gathers insights for improvement, and generates new goals to continue driving the process.

In this example, the Overlord successfully initiates the prompt chain process to address a random goal and demonstrates the adaptability and flexibility of the approach in tackling various objectives.

####################

U: Superb! Now let's explore reasoning tree's. Any idea on how we can utilize them to improve even further?

####################

Reasoning Trees can be an excellent addition to our approach, as they allow for structured exploration and evaluation of different options, hypotheses, and solutions. By incorporating Reasoning Trees, we can enhance the problem-solving capabilities of our system, enabling it to tackle complex problems more effectively.

Here's how we can utilize Reasoning Trees to improve our approach:

1. Problem Decomposition: When the Advisor receives a goal, it can break down the problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems. The Advisor will then create a Reasoning Tree structure, where each node represents a subproblem or decision point.

2. Exploration of Alternatives: For each subproblem or decision point, the Advisor can generate multiple alternative solutions or hypotheses. These alternatives can be represented as child nodes in the Reasoning Tree structure.

3. Evaluation and Prioritization: The Advisor, with the help of other specialized roles, can evaluate each alternative by comparing its potential benefits, risks, and costs. Based on this evaluation, the alternatives can be prioritized or ranked within the Reasoning Tree.

4. Sequential Execution: The Executor can start working on the highest-priority alternatives by creating and assigning prompts to specialized roles. As the alternatives are executed and their outcomes are observed, the Executor can update the Reasoning Tree accordingly.

5. Dynamic Adjustment: The Overlord, with the help of the Observer and Refiner, can monitor the progress of the approach as it works through the Reasoning Tree. If necessary, the Overlord can adjust priorities, explore new alternatives, or redefine subproblems based on the evolving circumstances and insights gained during the process.

6. Iterative Learning: As the approach progresses through the Reasoning Tree and accumulates knowledge and experience, it can use this information to refine its problem-solving strategies, improve its evaluation of alternatives, and adapt more effectively to new challenges.

By incorporating Reasoning Trees into our approach, we can enhance its ability to decompose complex problems, explore and evaluate alternative solutions, and adapt to changing circumstances. This structured and iterative approach to problem-solving can help our system tackle a wide range of tasks and achieve better outcomes.

####################

U: Makes sense. I think we need to create some more roles to implement reasoning trees properly.

####################

You're right; to fully utilize Reasoning Trees in our approach, we may need to introduce additional roles that specifically focus on various aspects of the problem-solving process. Here are some new roles that can help with the implementation of Reasoning Trees:

1. Problem Decomposer: This role is responsible for breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems. It works closely with the Advisor to create a structured Reasoning Tree representing the problem and its components.

2. Alternative Explorer: This role focuses on generating multiple alternative solutions or hypotheses for each subproblem or decision point. It ensures that a diverse range of options is considered, increasing the likelihood of finding an optimal solution.

3. Evaluator: The Evaluator assesses the potential benefits, risks, and costs of each alternative in the Reasoning Tree. It helps prioritize and rank alternatives, guiding the approach in selecting the most promising options to execute.

4. Learning Agent: This role is responsible for capturing insights and lessons learned during the problem-solving process. As the approach progresses through the Reasoning Tree, the Learning Agent accumulates knowledge that can be used to refine strategies and adapt more effectively to new challenges.

5. Feedback Integrator: The Feedback Integrator monitors the outcomes of executed alternatives and updates the Reasoning Tree accordingly. This role ensures that the approach remains responsive to real-world results and can dynamically adjust priorities and explore new alternatives as needed.

By introducing these new roles, we can better support the implementation of Reasoning Trees in our approach, enhancing its problem-solving capabilities and adaptability in addressing complex tasks. These roles will work together with the existing core and helper roles, contributing to a more robust and efficient system.

####################

U: Let's create these roles using our approach.

####################

To create these new roles using our approach, we'll start by defining the prompts for each role and refining them with the help of the Refiner. Then, we will assign these refined prompts to the Executor for execution.

1. Problem Decomposer:
- Prompt: "Break down the given problem into smaller, manageable subproblems to create a structured representation of the problem."
- Refined Prompt: "Systematically decompose the given problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, and organize them in a hierarchical structure that represents the problem's complexity."

2. Alternative Explorer:
- Prompt: "Generate multiple alternative solutions or hypotheses for each subproblem or decision point in the problem."
- Refined Prompt: "For each subproblem or decision point within the problem, brainstorm and propose a diverse range of potential solutions or hypotheses to ensure a comprehensive exploration of possibilities."

3. Evaluator:
- Prompt: "Assess the potential benefits, risks, and costs of each alternative in the Reasoning Tree and prioritize them accordingly."
- Refined Prompt: "Evaluate each alternative in the Reasoning Tree by thoroughly considering its potential benefits, risks, and costs, and prioritize the alternatives based on their overall potential for success."

4. Learning Agent:
- Prompt: "Capture insights and lessons learned during the problem-solving process and use this knowledge to refine strategies and adapt to new challenges."
- Refined Prompt: "Systematically document insights and lessons learned throughout the problem-solving process, and utilize this knowledge to improve problem-solving strategies and adapt more effectively to emerging challenges."

5. Feedback Integrator:
- Prompt: "Monitor the outcomes of executed alternatives, update the Reasoning Tree accordingly, and dynamically adjust priorities and explore new alternatives as needed."
- Refined Prompt: "Continuously observe the results of executed alternatives, update the Reasoning Tree based on real-world outcomes, and dynamically adjust priorities and explore new alternatives to optimize the problem-solving process."

Now that we have refined prompts for each new role, the Executor can assign these prompts to the appropriate specialized roles and facilitate their collaboration within the existing approach. By introducing these new roles, we can better support the implementation of Reasoning Trees and enhance the problem-solving capabilities of our system.

####################

U: Alright! Now one more test of our approach. The goal: create a perfect markdown sheet.

####################

To create a perfect markdown sheet using our approach, we'll start by defining the goal and initializing the core roles. Then, we'll execute the necessary steps and incorporate the new roles we've introduced.

# Our Approach to AGI: A Collaborative Problem-Solving System

## Overview

The proposed approach to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) involves a collaborative problem-solving system, where multiple instances of GPT work together to achieve complex goals. The system consists of core roles, helper roles, and specialized roles, all interacting through a combination of prompt chains and reasoning trees.

## Core Roles

1. **Advisor**: Provides guidance, analyzes goals, and offers insights on key factors and potential strategies.
2. **Prompter**: Creates specific prompts based on the Advisor's guidance and assigns them to specialized roles.
3. **Executor**: Facilitates the collaboration between specialized roles to achieve the desired goal.

## Helper Roles

1. **Observer**: Monitors the progress and ensures the goal is being pursued effectively.
2. **Refiner**: Works with the Prompter to improve the clarity and effectiveness of prompts.
3. **Connector**: Manages communication between roles to ensure smooth collaboration.
4. **Overlord**: Generates new goals, initiates prompt chains, and adjusts goals or sub-goals as needed.

## Specialized Roles

These roles are created dynamically based on specific goals or sub-goals, such as a Spanish Teacher, Software Development Instructor, Supply Chain Manager, or Energy Efficiency Expert.

## Problem-Solving Process

1. **Goal Generation**: The Overlord defines a goal and sends it to the Advisor.
2. **Initiating Prompt Chain**: The Advisor analyzes the goal and provides guidance, which the Prompter uses to create prompts for specialized roles.
3. **Execution and Collaboration**: The Executor assigns prompts to specialized roles and facilitates their collaboration to achieve the goal.
4. **Communication and Refinement**: The Connector, Observer, and Refiner ensure effective communication, monitor progress, and refine prompts as needed.
5. **Goal Adjustment and Evaluation**: The Overlord monitors progress, adjusts goals, and evaluates the overall performance of the approach.

## Reasoning Trees

Reasoning Trees provide a structured approach to problem-solving by breaking down complex problems into subproblems and evaluating alternative solutions. They enhance the system's problem-solving capabilities and adaptability.

## New Roles for Reasoning Trees

1. **Problem Decomposer**: Breaks down complex problems into smaller subproblems and creates a structured Reasoning Tree.
2. **Alternative Explorer**: Generates multiple alternative solutions or hypotheses for each subproblem or decision point.
3. **Evaluator**: Assesses the potential benefits, risks, and costs of each alternative and prioritizes them accordingly.
4. **Learning Agent**: Captures insights and lessons learned during the problem-solving process to refine strategies and adapt to new challenges.
5. **Feedback Integrator**: Monitors the outcomes of executed alternatives, updates the Reasoning Tree, and adjusts priorities and explores new alternatives as needed.

By integrating prompt chains, reasoning trees, and a diverse set of roles, this approach aims to create a flexible and powerful problem-solving system capable of addressing a wide range of tasks and challenges.
